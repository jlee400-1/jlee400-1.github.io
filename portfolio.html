            This online exhibition was crafted to unveil the traditional hunting culture within Taiwanese indigenous communities. Our approach prioritized accuracy and cultural sensitivity, with comprehensive field research informing the content.
        </p>
        <p>
            Utilizing Gather Town as our chosen platform, we developed various assets, interactions, and narratives. Our objective was to vividly portray the daily life of indigenous communities, offering visitors an immersive experience.

            Zook is an app for zoo visitors seeking engaging and informative animal content. We started by creating an affinity map and crafting detailed personas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Subsequently, we developed prototypes using Figma and conducted an online usability test to assess effectiveness and gather user feedback.

        <p>
            The flea market played a pivotal role in our collection weeding process. After cataloging and archiving reference books, magazines, and publications, we executed a targeted social media campaign to showcase our selections.
        </p>
        <p>
            This endeavor proved successful, drawing in over 1,000 attendees. The event's triumph was also underscored by the generated income, amounting to 20,000 NTD.

            The virtual exhibition spotlighted the cultural history of the Sakizaya,
an indigenous community in Taiwan. Our exploration delved into the domain of content design, resulting in a concise overview encapsulating the attire, cuisine, and festivals of the Sakizaya community —a sort of Cliff's Notes version.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using Instagram, we delivered concise introductions accompanied by graphic arts to reach a wide audience. By Leveraging the platform's story and highlight features, we effectively disseminated additional in-depth information, fostering a more profound understanding of the community's rich traditions and modern relevance.

       The themed book exhibition centered around Taiwanese traditional pastries. To bring the books to life and immerse visitors in local history and culture, books highlighting
distinctive pastries were collected and correlated with specific cities on a map of Taiwan. Complementing the exhibition’s narrative, a mascot was designed to enhance the overall experience.
