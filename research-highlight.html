            <td>Through professional skill training and project-based practice in a digital curation course, this study successfully completed the exhibition "Rabbit's Adventure: Exploring the World of Dough Figurine" as a demonstration of best practices in digital curation. In addition to presenting the methods and tools required for the digitization of cultural heritage, the study also deconstructs the practical applications of digital exhibitions. On the other hand, this paper further explores and summarizes the competencies and core skills necessary for digital curation. The results indicate that curators equipped with foundational curatorial concepts and practices, organizational planning, and digital content development abilities are better able to construct effective digital exhibitions. These findings are corroborated by the exhibition experiences of visitors, including knowledge enhancement, impressive interactive design, and immersive experiences. This paper proposes that the above-mentioned indicators be incorporated into digital curation pedagogy as recommendations for curriculum content planning.</td>
